# Completed-Games Registers

### _Logotype_
![Logotype of the program 'Completed-Games Registers'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComplexRalex/Completed-Games-Registers/master/res/gui/logotype.png "Logotype of the program.")

## Description
Software where you can have a record of every game you have beaten (completed) so far!

## Aim
If you want to save a list with all the games that you have completed so far, you can create a **completed-game _register_**. This one is an object that has the following fields:

* Name of the game.
* The year when you completed it.
* Your rating of the game (from 1 to 5).
* Some comments or thoughts about it.
* Your annotations, like something you must consider before playing it.
* A spoiler (at the *visualization* panel, it won't be visible at first).

The only one of the above mentioned that isn't optional is the first field: the **title of the game**.

Also, you can see additional information about the game like _its description_, _their publishers and developers_, _its genres_, and even an _image or screenshot_!
These last things are thanks to the [RAWG's database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs).

## How to run
All the ``run`` files are inside of the ``bin`` folder. Be sure to run them **at that same location**.

* In *Windows*, click and execute the ``run.bat`` file.
* In *Linux*, click and execute the ``run.sh`` file.

## Disclaimer
All the icons and images that are used in this program (except for those which can be downloaded through [RAWG's database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)) are entirely made by me, from zero.
I don't own any of the games that are mentioned on the screenshots.
